ALL     Remove Doxygen comments from .c file        addressed

40-42   Delete redundant commented code             addressed

55+     Space between function call                 addressed

66-78   Variable Declarations                       not addressed. To address
        this, I would need to declare and initialize pointers at the top of
        the function and then use malloc() to allocate memory. I opted not to
        change the program that profoundly and I left the errant declarations
        lower than the top of the function.

113-146 Variable declarations seperate from init    addressed

122-124 Delete redundant commented code             addressed

156     To many line breaks between blocks          addressed

173     To many line breaks between blocks          addressed
